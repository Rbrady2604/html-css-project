        <h2>Unit 1 outcome 1</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business:</h3>

        <p> IT in an modern business is more essential than ever.
        Not only being able to keep up to date with trends but with projects,
        emails, assignments, finances, inventory, the roles that IT
        can fill is vast. One of the main reasons is being able
        to communicate with people who are a part of the business from
        anywhere including around or out of where the business operates.

        In short IT in an modern business is the lifeblood and without it,
        the business will for behind or even fail [1]</p>

        <br>

        <h3>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h3>

        <p> In what you need to make a digital project successful is a team with
        a good understanding in IT and preferably a well diverse skill set this
        skill set could be knowledgeable in how to manage a team effectively to
        be able to just communicate in an online world with the rest of the
        team this will come in handy in understanding what and how the project/projects should be done.

        The team would need a place to communicate. This would be a place where
        the team would clearly voice their ideas, plans and show their work with
        everyone so that everyone is in the same loop.
        
        The team can also use one of the two methods normally use in the IT industry.
        Scrum or kanban each achieving the same goal in similar ways.
        
        In essence making another place online where you can clearly see and know what needs to be done,
        what's being worked on and what has been completed.</p>    

        <br>

        <h3>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h3>

        <p> Again the use of the scrum method or the kanban method is a great way of planning
        on how you want to set out and plan a project

        An example of the kanban method in use is where you can set out different
        tasks that need doing and moving them along from “to do” to “doing” to “done” here is one in use right here:</p>

        <br>

        <h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h3>

        <p>Some of the risks that might impact digital projects to fail are not being
        able to access the projects; this could be because of the internet connection
        being down or the project being miss managed so you can not access the 
        information needed to do your job properly.

        Another way that the might impact digital project to fail is the lack of knowledge
        in the team as if the team has never used or know very little on how to use a computer
        a change to make it a digital project might cause it to fail.
        
        So having a team that has some understanding of computers and a stable connection will
        go a long way to see that a project does not fail.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h3>

        <p> Selecting the right IT systems and software for the right job can be different from
        project to project but having a way that a team can communicate is one thing that
        will be the same in almost if not all projects so if I was in charge in making
        sure that a team gets what they need to get the job done.

        I would First give the team a device that can access the internet and the tools needed
        to work on the project to will mostly be a laptop in this case
        
        Next would be giving the team a place to communicate effectively and share ideas.
        An example of the tool I would give is Slack as that gives people a place to do the
        two things just mentioned above.
        
        Another step I would take is to give a place where the project status can be checked
        on by anyone within the team like Trello.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control </h3>

        <p> My chosen technologies have helped me achieve my outcome by giving me a place to store
        my ideas and to order anything that I know I need to do efficiently.

        The use of Git would also benefit me by giving me again a place where to put my code
        and organize it so I can see, change and test without actually going deep in the code
        and making changes that might break the code unknowingly and cause frustration.[3]
        
        Finally, Github would give me a place where I can ask for support for an issue I can't
        quite get the hang of, and other users can give input and add solutions to the code without
        changing the core code unless I think it's the right fit.[2]</p>

        <br>

        <h3>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h3>

        <p> The GDPR or the General Data Protection Regulations of 2018 impact projects that are
        in violation of the GDPR by using people's information without consent. [3]

        In turn, people have the right to know what's going on with their information at any
        given time and the right to remove it at a request. That means any digital projects will
        have to think about how the project is not only going to store information compliant with
        GDPR but how that information is gathered.</p>

        <br>

        <h2>unit 2 outcome 1</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page for Unit 2, outcome 1:</h3>

        <p> So I have 4 pages. Page 1 the home page (index) is just the first page you will 
            see when you go to my site. This just holds a navigation bar for my other pages 
            and some text explaining saying “welcome” and “this is my website”.

            Page 2 is about me. This holds information about me and what I have done over the 
            course like the text-based game.
            
            Page 3 holds all of outcome 1 just showing off the question and me answering said questions.
            
            And page 4 the same as page 3 but for outcome 2&3.
            
            I have overall gone with a blue themed look and everything co-siding to match that.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>

        <p> When making a website, copyright and being GDPR compliant are the two main things that
        should be at the top of developer's minds when creating a website this is because of
        the fines and even your website being taken down for going against them.

        For example, copyright gives the creator the right to claim the work they make as their
        own and if anyone uses or steal that work to use in their own creation like a website they
        have the right to claim that you use their work and to ask you to remove, credit or compensate
        them for using the thing they made without permission/consent to use it.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h3>

        <p> One way we could help people with disabilities to access web pages is the use of alt tags for
        the visually impaired. Alt tags just explain what the image is in text so, with software that
        can read out words to the user the software can pick up and read out what the alt tags say in
        turn hopefully giving some content on what that image is.

        Another way we can help people with disabilities is to give subtitles and transcripts when
        using a video on your web page. This is for people who can not hear very well, would benefit
        from knowing what's going on without trying to decipher every word that is being said with said video.
        
        Having clear navigation like clear to see buttons and links and the right use of colours (smart colours)
        not only improved on helping the disabled but just anyone who would use your website as the easier people 
        find it as a whole to navigate your website the more likely people who are disabled can start to understand
        what's going on as well.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>

        <p> The main 4 that are appropriate for a website .jpeg, .png, .gif and the .svg file type

        Each of them brings different advantages and disadvantages to them. Like
        .jpeg being a small file size that is easy to load that displays images.
        .png has a more high-quality image with more colours and control but is
        larger and may even not work with older browsers. .gif a small file type
        that can play a short “gif” that is a short animation within the website and
        finally .svg that is a vector meaning it's not pixel-based but is made using
        mathematical formulas making it seem that the quality does not fall in quality
        by the size or resolution of the image-making it great on different viewing
        platforms that if the platform allows it.[5]</p>
