            <h1>about me</h1>

            <p> I am interested in reading every now and then as I find it relaxing and a good alternative to the other activates I do in my own time. A book that I would like to read would
            be the Witcher series of books as I have heard it is a good read. This leads me to my main hobbies that would be video games. I have a good passion for the video game industry,
            as I find playing and trying new games interesting as well as playing with friends online as my main source of entertainment. I also enjoy modelling from time to time mainly small
            scale based, this would be from the WW2 era as WW2 vehicles and equipment fascinate me.</p>
