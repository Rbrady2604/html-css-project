        <h2>Unit 1 outcome 2</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h3>

        <p>I would say the tools I have used like Trello, allowed me to plan what 
            I need to do and visualized what I want it to look like, and visual studio 
            code, that let me work on the HTML and CSS simultaneously that I was easily 
            able to link the two together and edit it without closing or changing to a 
            different file. Overall I would say that I was happy with the decision on the 
            choice of tools I used to make the website.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were Appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h3>

        <p>The tools I had at my disposal were effective at letting me plan, make, and see 
            with little complaint. That is because being able to plan out on Trello what you 
            want to do and then making what you plan into reality with relative ease by using 
            visual studio make things genuinely less stressful in the way how visual studio displays 
            and let you work on multiple files at once with little to no setup. I think the chemistry 
            of Trello and visual studio goes very well with each other and that the choice to use the two was a good one.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h3>

        <p>The website, in my opinion, is that it shows everything I needed it to, by having 
            all the requirements that were asked for. So I am happy with it in that regard but 
            it could use some tuning up as I would say it is rough around the edges but I think 
            with the time I was given some corner cuts are to be expected but I feel with even a 
            day or two more said edges can be smoothed out. That being said, a lot of time went to 
            answering questions for all the outcomes. So overall having a website that goes over 
            all the requirements is a positive for me.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>

        <p>The improvements I could make is maybe to add some animations. I think the use of 
            animations would give the website more “pop”. Also having links change when you hover 
            over them would make the navigation bar more interesting and interactive as the user will 
            have more feedback and in turn letting the user know that clicking it would do something. 
            but the main change is to format the website slightly differently to make it more adaptable 
            to different screen sizes like different resolutions, tablets, or phones as I think having 
            the website adapt to all of the sizes as the best it can would be a huge improvement in my opinion.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>

        <p>The easiest outcome I can refer to in this case is the outcome 2 unit 2. Where it states 
            what it wants of the website. Leading me to concentrate on what the priority should be, 
            what can be left for later, and what can be left out. things that take too much time or 
            are not easy to implement can take away from the polish of the website and potentially not 
            having the requirements done for outcome 2 unit 2.</p>

        <br>
            
        <h2>Unit 1 outcome 3</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h3>

        <p> Overall I think having a team on this project would raise efficiency
            in turn. I think you could use this to have more features or more polish
            on the website as you can have people take turns working on the website
            or have people work on different pages at the same time. The main thing
            I would say is. If the team lacks communication it can cause confusion 
            with what every page should have and solving that may even take longer
            now as you have to not only take time away from developing now but you 
            need time to fix the issue that could have not even been one in the first place.</p>
    
        <br>

        <h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>

        <p> The way I improve my productivity and efficiency is to take a step back.
            This just can be instead of just constantly hammering one thing until it
            works what just lowers motivation when it does not work. You just take a
            break, have some time away from the screen, have a drink this way when you
            come back you will have a new approach to the situation and might just see
            what is causing the issue. Another way is if you have any peers that could
            have a look at what you are doing they could suggest a more efficient method
            or a solution to an issue you are having even just to motivate you to try or
            see a different way of doing things.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h3>

        <p> Starting with the design I could make it more consistent and finish with adding
            more features. I would improve how it looks for next time as the website looks blocky. 
            I would also avoid spending unnecessary time working on parts of the project that do not 
            need it or was asked for.

            By also having a team on a project can make projects be done with more efficiently. 
            But obviously by having more people on a project can increase how complex it will become. 
            So by having the right amount of people for the said project should be considered. 
            Having a big team requires a lot of planning and a lot of opinions to go through, 
            this can lead to the project to take longer overall.
            
            In terms of slack. this increases productivity by giving people a platform to communicate 
            with everyone at once, many teams would want a need for such a platform as Slack is a great 
            place to keep the team organized. As Slack has been designed with teams in mind, It gives all 
            team members the choice to ask questions to other teammates, edit and update them. Set reminders, 
            and many more features that make it a great choice for what it brings to that table.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.</h3>

        <p> In order to test digital solutions, I would first test the projects not only to ensure that they 
            work for me but also to see whether they work in practice as not all solutions are appropriate 
            for all people. So the best way to test something is by having a test with different environments 
            like setups and screens and so on but even doing lots of testing. Unforeseen issues can still arise. 
            But as long as you can adapt to the problems that arise, having countermeasures in place for in case, 
            Is a great way of making sure that if something goes wrong that you are able to solve the issue before 
            it becomes a major one.</p>
